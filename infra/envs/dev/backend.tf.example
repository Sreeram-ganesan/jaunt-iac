# Example Backend Configuration for Development Environment
# 
# This file shows how to configure the Terraform backend for the dev environment
# after the backend infrastructure has been created.
#
# Steps:
# 1. First, create the backend infrastructure using `make init-backend`
# 2. Copy this file to backend.tf in your environment directory
# 3. Update the bucket name and other values from the backend outputs
# 4. Run `terraform init` to configure the remote backend

# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket-name"
#     key            = "environments/dev/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-west-2"
#     dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
#     encrypt        = true
#   }
# }

# Example with actual values (replace with your outputs):
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "fastapi-terraform-state-dev"
#     key            = "environments/dev/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-west-2"
#     dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
#     encrypt        = true
#   }
# }
